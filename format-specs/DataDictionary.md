| Commodity/Industry Name                                | Name of the commodity or industry from the BEA Make and Use Tables 2012 categorization, except detail commodities, which use USEEIO v1.1 names, see Ingwersen and Yang 2017. |
| Substance                                              | Greenhouse gas: 'Carbon dioxide' is CO2; 'Methane' is CH4; 'Nitrous oxide' is N2O; and 'Other Greenhouse Gases' include HFC-23, HFC-32, HFC-125, HFC-134a, HFC-143a, HFC-236fa, CF4, C2F6, C3F8, C4F8, SF6, and NF3. |
| Unit                                                   | Unit of emission factors for each gas. 'Other GHGs' are aggregated and reported in CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalents) using the IPCC AR4 100-year GWP factors. Purchaser price is the price paid by the consumer and equals to the producer prices plus any associated margin, which generally include distribution, wholesale and retail costs. |
| Supply Chain Emission Factors without Margins          | Direct and indirect GHG emissions associated with production of commodity or industry from cradle to the point of production(kg) per 2018 USD of that commodity or industry in the US in purchaser price. |
| Margins of Supply Chain Emission Factors               | Direct and indirect GHG emissions associated with production of commodity or industry from the point of production to the point of sale (kg) per 2018 USD of that commodity or industry in the US in purchaser price of that commodity or industry in the US. |
| Supply Chain Emission Factors with Margins             | Direct and indirect GHG emissions associated with production of commodity or industry from cradle to the point of sale(kg) per 2018 USD of that commodity or industry in purchaser price of that commodity or industry in the US. |
